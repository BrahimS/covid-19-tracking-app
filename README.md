#COVID-19 tracker web application

##description:
This application provides data concerning the progress of COVID-19 in the world. It also gives us information about this virus, how it spreads, how to protect against it.

##Motivation:
Like everyone today, my daily life is turned upside down by COVID-19.
So I learned a lot about this virus and especially how to protect myself and my family.
I also wanted to know the progression of this pandemic throughout the world.

Every day, I went to three different health ministry websites, of three different countries: France, where I currently live, Switzerland where I work punctually and Morocco where I am born, and return there from time to time.

After three weeks of repeating this process, I've decided to create this application, which allows me and everyone who wish to have a single source of information about COVID-19 and how it progresses in worldwide.
